 AI-Powered Notepad Assistant Chatbot 
 â€¢ I developed an AI-driven notepad assistant chatbot using Python and Flask, designed to intelligently assist 
users with a wide range of tasks. The chatbot is capable of answering user queries, processing uploaded files 
(such as text documents and PDFs), and managing various productivity-related functions. A key feature of 
the system is its ability to generate images from text input using text-to-image generation models, enabling 
users to visualize ideas and concepts. To enhance personalization and usability, I integrated a user history 
feature that stores and displays past searches and interactions. This project was built to provide a smart, 
efficient, and user-friendly assistant that caters to both personal and creative needs.
